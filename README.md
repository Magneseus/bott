Made in 48 hours for the 2015 Carleton Codeathon.

This is a (very) small game written in the Unity Engine, and it was the first thing I've ever worked on in a group or a game engine such as Unity. As such it's quite basic, and there are numerous bugs which I'm aware of.

Inspired by games like BloodBowl, it's really just a simple game of soccer, with weapons to attack each other while playing. There is also a very rudimentary implementation of multiplayer written in (relying heavily on Unity's built in networking capabilities) and you can create a single game online which other people can join through the main Unity server network.1
